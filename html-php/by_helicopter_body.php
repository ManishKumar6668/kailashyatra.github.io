			<p class="mb-4">Lots of people have misconception about this route thinking they will make the Manasa
				Sarovara and Kailash Parikrama by Helicopter which is not the case. This route can be undertaken by
				yatris who are financially sound and also considering the time factor. This route starts from Lucknow to
				Nepalgunj by Road; Nepalgunj to Simikot by Flight and by helicopter from Simikot to Hilsa. Hilsa is the
				border of Nepal, we have to undergo entry formalities, crossing the border by walk and later upon
				completing immigration formalities at the Tibet border, proceed to Taklakot by Bus. A day's time is
				given for acclimatization and later proceed to Hore (Horchu) by the side of Manasa Sarovar and also
				cover Manasa Sarovara Parikrama of 102 Kms. on road by the bus and proceed to Darchen (Base camp), we
				have a common route for Kailash Parikrama as before.
